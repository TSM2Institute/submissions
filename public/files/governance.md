# TSM2 Institute Governance Protocol v1.0

## Final Registration & Archiving Protocol
**Post-Compliance, Examiner-Validated Workflow**

---

## Final Steps: Post-Compliance Pathway
*Mandatory — no exceptions*

---

### Step 10: AI Compliance Confirmation (Gate Closed)

**Trigger:**  
Submission has passed all 9 Institute Compliance Criteria with no failures.

**Output:**
- Formal Compliance Pass Certificate (AI-Issued)
- Locked Compliance Case Record
- Submission status changes to: *"Compliance-Cleared — Pending Examiner Review"*

**Important:**  
Passing compliance does not grant registration. It only grants eligibility for examiner review.

---

### Step 11: Assignment to Qualified Registered Examiner

**Purpose:**  
To restore human scientific responsibility, complementary to (not replaced by) AI or peer review.

**Process:**
- Submission is routed to a Registered Qualified Examiner (RQE)
- Examiner is selected based on:
  - Domain relevance
  - No conflict of interest
  - Standing within the Examiner Register
- Review is blind to author identity where possible

**Examiner Role (strictly limited):**

*Verify that:*
- The 9 compliance criteria were correctly applied
- No hidden assumptions or category breaches exist
- The submission genuinely satisfies mechanistic, evolutionary, and CEC requirements

*Examiner may not:*
- Introduce new theory requirements
- Reject on taste, style, or orthodoxy
- Override compliance rules

---

### Step 12: Examiner Confirmation or Return

**Possible Outcomes:**

**CONFIRMED**  
Examiner signs off: *"Compliance assessment verified. No unresolved violations."*  
Submission proceeds to registration.

**RETURNED WITH FINDINGS**  
Examiner identifies:
- Misapplied criterion
- Overlooked failure
- Boundary breach

Submission is returned to:
- Author (if amendable), or
- Archive as "Non-Compliant — Examiner Review"

*Returned submissions do not receive registration numbers.*

---

### Step 13: Sequential Registration Number Assignment

**Condition:**  
Only after Examiner Confirmation.

**Registration Number Format (example):**  
`TSM2-REG-000042`

**Rules:**
- Numbers are sequential, immutable, and never reused
- No provisional numbers
- No skipped numbers without logged cause

**Registration Entry Includes:**
- Registration number
- Title & abstract
- Author(s)
- Compliance Case ID
- Examiner ID (not public-facing unless requested)
- Date & version

---

### Step 14: Archival Lock & Public Record

**Actions:**

Submission is:
- Archived in the Permanent Registry
- Hash-locked for integrity
- Time-stamped

Any future revision requires:
- New submission
- New compliance pass
- New examiner confirmation
- New registration number

**Public Registry Status:**  
*"Registered, Examiner-Confirmed, Archived"*

---

## Governance Principles

| Principle | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| AI | Enforces structure |
| Examiners | Enforce judgement |
| Registration | Enforces accountability |
| Archive | Enforces permanence |

**This system explicitly avoids:**
- Unregulated peer review
- Editorial gatekeeping
- Prestige bias
- Silent rejection
- Retroactive rule changes

---

## System Status

The Institute now has:

- Submission intake
- 9-criteria compliance gate
- AI audit trail
- Human examiner responsibility
- Sequential registration
- Immutable archive

*This is a complete scientific governance system.*

---

## Official Pipeline (Active)

### Phase I: Submission & Compliance
1. Submission received (text / images / links / extracts)
2. Assigned Compliance Case ID
3. Evaluated against 9 Mandatory Criteria
4. Output: 9-Criteria Scorecard, Pass/Fail determination, Fix list (if applicable)

### Phase II: Compliance Clearance
- If (and only if) all 9 criteria pass:
  - AI Compliance Pass Certificate issued
  - Status set to: *"Compliance-Cleared — Pending Examiner Review"*

### Phase III: Examiner Validation
1. Submission routed to a Registered Qualified Examiner (RQE)
2. Examiner verifies:
   - Correct application of criteria
   - No hidden violations
   - No category leakage
3. Examiner outcomes: Confirm (proceed) or Return (no registration)

### Phase IV: Registration & Archive
- Upon examiner confirmation:
  - Sequential Registration Number assigned
  - Entry logged in Permanent Registry
  - Submission hash-locked and time-stamped
- Archive status: *Registered · Examiner-Confirmed · Immutable*

---

## Key Governance Guarantees

- No silent rejection
- No prestige bias
- No peer-review ambiguity
- No AI authority without human confirmation
- No registration without accountability
- No retroactive rule changes
